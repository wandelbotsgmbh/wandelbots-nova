        Switch between monitor and control usage as default for a robot controller.
        Monitoring mode is used to read information from the robot controller and control mode is used to command the robot system.
        As long as the robot controller is connected via network monitoring mode is always possible. To switch to control mode
        the robot controller must be in `automatic` or `manual` operating mode and safety state 'normal' or 'reduced'. If the robot controller is in `manual` operating mode,
        you have manually confirm the control usage activation on the robot control panel. This manual confirmation can't be replaced with this API.
        Without manual confirmation the robot controller will stay in monitor mode.

        The robot system will try to activate the required operation mode for the requested usage unless no active call requires a different mode.

        > **NOTE**
        >
        > Some robot controllers prevent the external activation of automatic operating mode. In this case, changing the operating mode manually at the robot controller is mandatory.

      summary: Stream Joints
      description: |
        Move one or more joints of a motion group with specified velocities via a websocket.

        The purpose of a joint jogging motion is to maneuver a motion group in one or more joints with a specified velocity for each joint.
        The sign of the velocity determines the direction of the joint movement. The velocity is given in [rad/s].
        In contrast to a planned motion, a jogging motion can be changed dynamically while the motion group is in motion.

        Only one single client at a time can jog a particular motion group.
        If another client tries to jog the same motion group at the same time, the second call will fail.

        The movement of the motion group will start as soon as:
        * the motion group is not in motion
        * the websocket connection is established
        * the first request has been sent

        As long as the jogging motion is ongoing, responses will be sent continuously and contain the current state of the motion group.
        The responses will be sent with the specified rate according to the *response_rate* parameter of the initial websocket request.
        While in motion, the desired joint velocity can be changed by sending a new request to the same websocket.
        The motion and sending of the replies will stop when:
        * a [stopJogging](stopJogging) request was received, processed, and the movement stopped
          Motion group state will be published in the original command stream until the motion group has fully stopped.
        * the client cancels the stream (not recommended, because final stopping position will not be returned from the stream)

        When a physical limit (e.g. joint limit) is reached, the motion group will stop moving in the desired direction.
        The stream, howewer, will continue to send the state until the client cancels the stream or sends the [stopJogging](stopJogging) request.

        **Usage example:**

        1. Open a websocket via python and start the jogging motion:
        ```bash
        > python -m websockets "ws://<IP of Wandelbots NOVA API>/api/v1/cells/<your cell id>/motion-groups/move-joint"
        ```
        2. Send the following message to move with a velocity of 0.1 rad/s (negative) for joint 5 and 0.2 rad/s for joint 6:
        ```json
        {
          "motion_group": "<your motion group id>",
          "joint_velocities": [0, 0, 0, 0, -0.1, 0.2],
          "response_rate": 500
        }
        ```
        The provided NOVA API clients also natively support jogging motions, without the need to manually open a websocket.

        > **NOTE**
        >
        > If the jogging movement is stopped immediately, ensure that
        >
        > - A websocket connection is established. Websockets can be kept open until the robot's movement is done as opposed to a simple HTTP GET request.
        >
        > - The motion group is not in motion by another jogging movement or a planned movement.


        > **NOTE**
        >
        > If the robot does not move, ensure that
        >
        > - The joint velocity values are not zero,
        >
        > - The motion group is not in a state where it cannot move further (e.g. joint limit reached).

        > **NOTE**
        >
        > If the specified velocities are higher than the maximum allowed by the robot controller, the motion group will move with the maximum allowed velocities.

        Move TCP along/around a specified direction vector with a specified velocity via a websocket.

        The purpose of a direction jogging motion is to move a device in exactly one direction with a specified maximum velocity.
        The sign of the velocity determines the direction of the movement: Positive [+] or Negative [-]. The velocity is given in [mm/s].
        In contrast to a planned motion, a jogging motion can be changed dynamically while the motion group is in motion.

        Only one single client at a time can jog a particular motion group.
        If another client tries to jog the same motion group at the same time, the second call will fail.

        The movement of the motion group will start as soon as:
        * the motion group is not in motion
        * the websocket connection is established
        * the first request has been sent

        As long as the jogging motion is ongoing, responses will be sent continuously and contain the current state of the motion group.
        The responses will be sent with the specified rate according to the *response_rate* parameter of the initial websocket request.
        While in motion, the desired direction and velocity can be changed by sending a new request to the same websocket.
        The motion and sending of the replies will stop when:
        * a [stopJogging](stopJogging) request was received, processed, and the movement stopped
          The motion group state will be published in the original command stream until the motion group has stopped.
        * the client cancels the stream (not recommended, because final stopping position will not be returned from the stream)

        When a physical limit (e.g. workspace boundary) is reached, the motion group will stop moving in the desired direction.
        The stream, howewer, will continue to send the state until the client cancels the stream or sends the [stopJogging](stopJogging) request.

        Singularities are avoided during a jogging motion. This avoidance can result in deviations from the specified direction. The amount of deviation depends on the robot type and current velocity.
        These mechanisms can lead to a small deviation from the specified direction. The size of deviation is depending on robot type and current velocity.

         **Usage example:**

        1. Open a websocket via python and start the jogging motion:
        ```bash
        > python -m websockets "ws://<IP of Wandelbots NOVA API>/api/v1/cells/<your cell id>/motion-groups/move-tcp"
        ```
        2. Send the following message to the server to move current TCP 2 parts up in z direction and one part in negative y direction
        with 0.2 mm/s along the specified direction vector:
        ```json
        {
          "motion_group": "<your motion group id>",
          "position_direction": {
            "y": -0.5,
            "z": 1
          },
          "rotation_direction": {},
          "position_velocity": 0.2,
          "response_rate": 500
        }
        ```
        The NOVA API clients support jogging motions without the need to manually open a websocket.

        2. Validate and load the planned trajectory using the [loadPlannedMotion](loadPlannedMotion) endpoint.
        3. Execute the loaded trajectory using the [streamMove](streamMove) endpoint.

        If the trajectory is not executable, the [PlanTrajectoryResponse](PlanTrajectoryResponse)
        will contain the joint trajectory up until the error, e.g.
        all samples until a collision occurs.
        EXCEPTION: If a CartesianPTP or JointPTP motion command has an invalid target,
        the response will contain the trajectory up until the start of the invalid PTP motion.

      summary: Load Planned Motion
      description: |-
        Loads and validates the data of a planned motion into a motion session.
        The response contains information about the validated motion.

        Validation can lead to three different results:
        - Fully valid: The whole planned motion can be executed from start to end. The response will contain the session to move the robot.
        - Partially valid: Only parts of the planned motion can be executed. The response will contain the session to move the robot and information about the failure for the part that is not executable.
        - Invalid: The planned motion can not be executed. The response will tell you, which information about the reason of failure.

        If the motion is at least partially valid, the parts of the motion that are valid can be executed using the [streamMoveForward](streamMoveForward) endpoint.

        You can use the following workflows:
          - Plan motions using the [planMotion](planMotion) endpoint,
          - Store the planned motion persistently,
          - Use this endpoint to reload the stored motion and get a motion session for it.
          - Execute the loaded motion using the [streamMoveForward](streamMoveForward) endpoint.

        OR:
          - Generate a planned motion with [planTrajectory](planTrajectory) or your own motion planner,
          - Send the planned motion to this endpoint to validate it and get a motion session for it,
          - Execute your motion using the [streamMoveForward](streamMoveForward) endpoint.

        Once a planned motion is validated, it is treated like a motion session and will appear in the list of available motions, see [listMotions](listMotions) endpoint.
        You can then execute a motion session with the [streamMoveForward](streamMoveForward) endpoint.

        > Websocket endpoint

        Provides execution control over a previously planned trajectory. Enables the caller to attach I/O actions to the trajectory.

        Understanding the concept of location:
          The location or path parameter specifies the exact position along a trajectory.
          The location is a scalar value that ranges from 0 to `n`,
          where `n` denotes the number of motion commands, or trajectory segments, e.g. line, p2p, etc. See [planMotion](planMotion).
          Each integer value of the location corresponds to one motion command, e.g. 3.0 to 3.999 could be a line.

        ### Preconditions

        - The motion group's control mode is not claimed by any other endpoint.
        - The motion group's joint position are at start location specified with InitializeMovementRequest.

        ### Requests

        #### 1. Send InitializeMovementRequest to lock the trajectory to this connection
          The following actions are executed:
          - Sets robot controller mode to control mode,
          - Sets start location of the execution

          Keep in mind that only a single trajectory can be locked to a websocket connection at a time and not unlocked anymore.
          To execute another trajectory, a new connection must be established.

        #### 2. Send StartMovementRequest to start the movement

        Sets direction of movement, default is forward.

        #### **Optional**

        - To pause, send PauseMovementRequest before the movement has reached its end location.
        - Change the movement's velocity with PlaybackSpeedRequest after initializing the movement with InitializeMovementRequest.

        ### Responses

        - InitializeMovementResponse is sent to signal the success or failure of the InitializeMovementRequest.
        - Movement responses are streamed after a StartMovementRequest successfully started the movement.
          Movement responses are streamed in a rate that is defined as the multiple of the controller step-rate closest to
          but not exceeding the rate configured by InitializeMovementRequest.
        - Standstill reponse  is sent once the movement has finished or has come to a standstill due to a pause.
        - PauseMovementResponse is sent to signal the success of the PauseMovementRequest. It does not signal the end of the movement.
          End of movement is signaled by Standstill reponse .
        - PlaybackSpeedResponse is sent to signal the success of the PlaybackSpeedRequest.
        - MovementError with error details is sent in case of an unexpected error, e.g. controller disconnects during movement.

        ### Tips and Tricks

        - A movement can be paused and resumed by sending PauseMovementRequest and StartMovementRequest.
        - Send PlaybackSpeedRequest before StartMovementRequest to reduce the velocity of the movement before it starts.
        - Send PlaybackSpeedRequest repeatedly to implement a slider. The velocity of the motion group can be adjusted with each controller step.
        Therefore, if your app needs a slider-like UI to alter the velocity of a currently running movement,
        you can send PlaybackSpeedRequest with different speed values repeatedly during the movement.
        - A closed trajectory (end and start joint position are equal) can be repeated by sending StartMovementRequest after the movement has finished.

        If the Wandelscript is not executable, e.g. points that are out of reach, or the joints encounter a singularity, the
        reason is returned.

        The plan operation can be used in other operating modes besides control mode.

        The Wandelscript can either be submitted as is, using Content-type text/plain,
        or as content-type application/json with the Wandelscript under "code" alongside a set of values provided under "initial_state".

            Robot is not able to perform the motion due to hard or soft restrictions.
            This can be due to a variety of reasons:

            - The robot is too close to a singularity,
            - The robot is too close to a joint limit,
            - Robot operating mode could not be set to the desired mode,
            - An operating mode change occurred during the motion.

      summary: Stream Joint Configuration
      description: |
        This stream provides the commanded joint state
        and sets a motion groups joint configuration, e.g. to move a motion group.
        The concept is that an application is using the Motion Service to move a motion group.
        The Motion Service is commanding the desired joint
        configuration of a motion group.

        Physical motion groups move to this joint configuration.

        With physical motion groups, this takes some time and only works if
        possible.

        And you have the *actual* joint state - the current real motion group
        configuration.

        Again, this stream is providing *commanded* joint state!
        It is __not__ providing the *actual* joint state!
        (Please file a request - if you need a stream of the *actual* joint state)

        When the virtual controller receives joint commands the joint configuration is immediately adapted to match the incoming joint configurations.
        CAUTION: Incoming joint configurations are not visualized and their velocity limits are not checked.
        we don't even check limits!

        Possible use cases are:
        1. Creating a robotic application that dynamically adapts to the configured joints on the robot controller, using this stream to feed
        new joint configurations back to the motion group.

        The stream only sends data to the robot controller if a motion is executed.

        If the robot controller's joint configuration differs too much from the incoming joint configuration, a following error occurs.
        Joint configurations that result in following errors are executed only for motions with a low velocity.

        2. Mimic Freedrive motions.

        <!-- theme: danger -->

        > **DANGER**
        >
        > If the incoming joint configuration is set to maximum velocity, the movement to reach this incoming joint configuration will be executed with maximum speed regardless
        > of safety zones and mechanical limits.

      summary: Get Default Link Chain

      description: |
        Returns the default collision link chain for a given motion group model.

        See [getPlanningMotionGroupModels](getPlanningMotionGroupModels) for supported motion group models.

        The default link chain is derived from 3D models and optimized for collision detection within NOVA.

        The default link chain includes link shapes only. It does not include any attached components like wire feeders or sensors.

        Use the `stored_link_chain` or `link_chain` field in [storeCollisionScene](storeCollisionScene) to attach additional shapes to the link reference frames.
        Additional shapes may overlap each other per link and may also overlap the respective link's default shape.

        The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different
        programming environments including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by
        [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `status` message contains three pieces
        of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more
        about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design
        Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).

        This structure describes a set of joint values of a motion group.
        We call a set of joint values describing the current position in joint space of a motion group a "joint position". Joint position was chosen as the term to be consistent with the terms "joint velocity" and "joint acceleration".
        `joints` must have as many entries as the motion group's degrees of freedom to be valid.

        Indicates that the robot controller is currently performing a mode transition.

        ### ROBOT_SYSTEM_MODE_DISCONNECT

        There is no communication with the robot controller at all. All connections are closed.
        No command is sent to the robot controller while in this mode. No IO interaction is possible in this mode!
        All move requests will be rejected in this mode!

        ### ROBOT_SYSTEM_MODE_MONITOR

        A connection to the robot controller is established to only read the robot controller state.
        No command is sent to the robot controller while in this mode. It is possible to receive IO information.
        All move requests will be rejected in this mode!

        ### ROBOT_SYSTEM_MODE_CONTROL

        An active connection is established with the robot controller and the robot system is cyclic commanded
        to stay in its actual position. The robot controller state is received in the cycle time of the robot controller.
        Requests via the MotionService and JoggingService will be processed and executed in this mode.
        IO interaction is possible in this mode! **In this mode the robot system can be commanded to move.**

        ### ROBOT_SYSTEM_MODE_FREE_DRIVE

        Like ROBOT_SYSTEM_MODE_MONITOR a connection to the robot controller is established to only read the robot controller state.
        The difference is that the motion groups can be moved by the user (Free Drive). Thus, the servo motors are turned on.
        All move requests will be rejected in this mode! **This mode is not supported by every robot!**
        Use [getSupportedModes](getSupportedModes) to evaluate if the device support free drive.

        The type of rotation description that is used to specify the rotation.

        **Quaternion notation**

        * The rotation is represented using a quaternion: [x, y, z, w].
        * The vector part [x, y, z] is the imaginary part of the quaternion, and the scalar part [w] is the real part.

        **Rotation Vector notation**

        * The rotation is represented using an axis-angle representation:
        > axis = Vector[0:2]
        > angle = |axis| in [rad]
        > axis.normalized * angle

        **Euler notation**

        * *extrinsic* fixed external reference system
        * *intrinsic* reference system fixed to rotation body
        > angles = Vector[0:2] in [rad].
        * ZYX, ZXZ,...
          - mapping of the given angles values to the (either intrinsic
            or extrinsic) axes in the stated order.

        A link chain is a kinematic chain of links that is connected via joints.
        A motion group can be used to control the motion of the joints in a link chain.

        A link is a group of colliders that is attached to the link reference frame.

        The reference frame of a link is obtained after applying all sets of Denavit-Hartenberg-parameters from base to (including) the link index.

        This means that the reference frame of the link is on the rotation axis of the next joint in the kinematic chain.
        Example: For a motion group with 2 joints, the collider reference frame (CRF) for link 1 is on the rotation axis of joint 2. The chain looks like:
        - Origin >> Mounting >> Base >> (CRF Base) Joint 0 >> Link 0 >> (CRF Link 0) Joint 1 >> Link 1 >> (CRF Link 1) Flange (CRF Tool) >> TCP

        Adjacent links in the kinematic chain of the motion group are not checked for mutual collision.

        A singularity is a point in the robot's workspace where the robot loses one or more degrees of freedom with regards to moving its TCP.
        This means the robot cannot move or rotate the TCP in a certain direction from this specific point.

        Use PTP motions if possible. They will almost never fail due to singularities (only if the target point is at a singularity).

        Alternatively change the robot TCP's path to avoid moving through this point or try to move the TCP through this point in a different direction.

        Afterwards, you are able to call [streamMoveForward](streamMoveForward) or [streamMoveBackward](streamMoveBackward) to move along planned motion.
        Use the [stopExecution](stopExecution) endpoint to stop the motion gracefully.

            If you want to start your movement from an arbitrary location, e.g. in combination with [streamMoveToTrajectoryViaJointPTP](streamMoveToTrajectoryViaJointPTP),
            set the location by respecting the following format:
            - The location is a scalar value that defines a position along a path, typically ranging from 0 to `n`,
              where `n` denotes the number of motion commands
            - Each integer value of the location corresponds to a specific motion command,
              while non-integer values interpolate positions within the segments.
            - The location is calculated from the joint path

                            Wandelbots NOVA will not interpolate the state but rather round it to the nearest step rate below the configured response rate.
            Minimal response rate is the step rate of controller.

        ## BEHAVIOR_AUTOMATIC
        This is the default behavior.
        The motion group instantly takes any commanded joint configuration as actual joint state.
        Configures the compliance of the virtual robot with the normal ControllerState cycle time. If set, the virtual robot will act like a physical one, e.g. with a cycle time of 8ms to respond to a new joint state command.
        ## BEHAVIOR_AUTOMATIC_NOT_COMPLY_WITH_CYCLETIME
        Configures the compliance of the virtual robot with the normal ControllerState cycle time. If set, the robot will respond as fast as possible, limited only by software execution speed. Because of that the execution of a movement requires less time than with BEHAVIOR_AUTOMATIC.
        ## BEHAVIOR_EXTERNAL_SOURCE
        The external client is the only source of actual joint state changes.
        This mode is used to enable third party software indicating the current joint state via [externalJointsStream](externalJointsStream).

      description: |
        Maps a Wandelbots NOVA motion group to its configuration in the collision scene. Key must be a motion group identifier.

        Values are collision motion group objects.

        A collision motion group defines a motion group in the collision scene.

        The motion group is attached to the origin of the scene.
        To relocate the motion group, configure its mounting offset on the physical controller.
        This ensures that the definition of motion commands and collision scenes use the same coordinate system.
        The kinematic chain looks like this:
        - Origin >> Mounting >> Base >> Joint 0 >> Link 0 >> Joint 1 >> [â€¦] >> TCP

        A `tool` is treated like another link attached to the end (flange) of the kinematic chain.
        All tool colliders are described in the flange frame.

        There are two types of objects in the scene:
        - `colliders`: Each collider is attached directly to the origin of the scene: Origin >> Collider
        - `motion-groups`: Each motion group is assigned a kinematic chain of links with a special collider, called tool, attached to the last element.
          The motion group is attached to the origin of the scene via its mounting: Origin >> Mounting >> Motion Group Base >> [â€¦]
